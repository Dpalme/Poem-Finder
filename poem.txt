I Bring a Life of That.. To an End
I want to say so much
But sometimes words aren't enough
Sometimes our tongues can't dance or tap
A rhythm that can express all that's within them
For at times, in a word can live
Not just a thought, but a metropolis
And if not magnified, they're dismissed
As just vowels grouped with consanants

But..

I’m not a simple person, but I don’t think anyone is
An ant constructs a labyrinth without ever really knowing it
And a spider forgets it’s artistry, and it’s the one who’s sewing it
So here’s to not knowing the supposed growing vastness
And being one of many ants, victim of death and taxes
And to the tapestry likely sewn due to all of the actions
Of us people, and being fine without some purposes to back them

See, I feel cursed at times
Cursed as the disconnected
It’s as if, to my own life, I must remain objective
Like every frame, of every second, dancing across my eyes
Are just that, a show, and to my soul they’re merely televised
And I’m stuck in this theater of the senses and cognition
Forced to view this life pass, like a projector full of pictures
I want to fall in love, feel some connection with another soul
But maybe in another life, I think, if ever at all

There’s so much shame involved in everything I’ve done
They say mistakes make you who you are, but, I liked who I was
So here’s to the future, and here’s to you
Maybe you can learn from what I’ve done in this pathetic human suit

But, maybe, with a chance
We’ll begin again
